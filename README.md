VIM CONFIGURATION
=================
To use it:

1. clone the repository to ~/.vim
2. symlink your .vimrc to ~/.vim/vimrc with the following command:
        ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc .vimrc

NOTES
=====

I use vundle to manage all of my plugins. I found that it makes plugin very easy
and makes it easy to add and remove plugins.
